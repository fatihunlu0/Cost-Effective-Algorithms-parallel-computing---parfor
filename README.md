Microwave Circuit Design with Cost Effective Algorithms
The algorithms used in the transistor models are run more than once in order to give an effective result. In this study, the Parfor function was used to determine whether the time was obtained by running parallel in differential evolution (DE), cuckoo search (CS), and firefly (FF) algorithms. Other algorithms except CS have provided significant time savings.
